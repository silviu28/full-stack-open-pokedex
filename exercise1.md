For this hypothetical application I decided to go with Java. Java has many build tools, but usually the most popular ones are Maven and Gradle, with Maven being used on older projects. Testing on Java is usually done with the JUnit library, with a different approach to writing text than something like JavaScript, where instead of writing test suites we write test methods in a test class, which then get run when we call Gradle or Maven with the "test" argument. There are several linting tools for Java too, but they're more uncommon than with something like JavaScript, where you have a lot of weird syntax quirks. Java is a much more strict language, you can't put as many semicolons as you want or not write function parameters in usual functions to just pass them as 'undefined'.
Besides Jenkins and GitHub actions there's also GitLab CI, CircleCI and AzureCI, all providing different tooling for the pipeline.
This project is a pretty darn serious so, which would mean that the best course of action would be to have a self-hosted repository and CI/CD pipeline. As previously stated in the course, this would remove the dependence on another service and is much more scalable and customizable. Jenkins is also the most used tool for this job in the Java ecosystem - now we have twice the boilerplate! At least our app will be stable and run pretty fast. Testability in unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end tests will be very good.
This is a pretty old but common setup for many companies. Not to mention, Java has many utilities for building large scale enterprise applications, such as Spring, native support with Kafka and Cassandra. The downside will be that it might be a tad bit more boring and verbose.
